Why the cloud is awesome
========================
You can:

* Use a virtual machine for your research &mdash; and free up your own computer for your own use
* Launch a virtual machine just for yourself, or share it on a project
* Access the virtual machine from anywhere
* Share resources easily with collaborators &mdash; no authentication or firewall dramas
* Run a web service with no overhead
* Test software and code without risking your own computer
* Try things out &mdash; then shut down and walk away
* Get access to extra computation when you need it
* Combine the virtual machine with federally funded storage so your project has the resources it needs
